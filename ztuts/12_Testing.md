# Testing :

## API Testing with SuperTest, Mocha, Chai

* This is different than normal testing.
  * Normal testing has QA testing and normal testing.
  * This is API testing.


1. We put "assertions" for testing
2. (Developer)API Testing has "asssertions"
3. **Asssertion** means the fact which is reality.
4. It will always run.
5. The developer itself tests and not some other tester.

### SuperTest

1. Server/API/App runner
2. It directly runs the server

### Mocha

1. It is a framework which runs all the test cases.
2. It makes a separate environment to run tests.


### Chai

1. Here, we specify the cases 
2. It makes assertions against API.

Mocha ---> SuperTest ---> Chai 

## Types of Testing :

1. Unit Testing
   1. Testing a single function.
2. Integration Testing
   1. It can vary
   2. It is a rare testing
   3. It is a combination of variation functions
3. End-to-end Testing
   1. Means you are giving an input and getting an output
   2. Testing the output by freezing it.
